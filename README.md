# Indians-kids-screentime-in-2025
In today's digital age, screens are an inseparable part of a child's daily life. This project aims to explore how Indian children in 2025 are engaging with screen-based devicesâ€”and more importantly, what influences their screen time behavior.

Using machine learning, we analyze and predict daily screen usage patterns based on key factors like a child's age, gender, and parental control settings. The ultimate goal is to build a model that can forecast screen time categories, helping parents, educators, and policymakers make more informed decisions to foster healthier digital habits among young users.

By uncovering meaningful patterns, this work hopes to contribute to a deeper understanding of digital well-being for the next generation.
